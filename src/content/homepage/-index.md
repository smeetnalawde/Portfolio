  title: "About Me"
  content: "I began my career in a fast-paced startup where I learned one powerful truth — data drives everything. I wasn’t just writing code; I was solving real business problems, building quick prototypes, breaking things, fixing them, and watching my work impact actual users. That environment pushed me into Machine Learning and taught me how scalable systems are built under pressure. Since then, I’ve committed myself to becoming an engineer who can turn raw data into intelligent, real-world solutions."
